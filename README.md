This repository contains code for graphing cases, deaths, and other data on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.  This code is intended for personal use and to explore data visualization using [plotly](https://plotly.com/r/) and for job control using [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake)

## Data Sources
Data on US cases is from a compilation of US state and county-level rates provided by the New York Times at https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.  The data is incorporated in this repository as a submodule; currently it needs to be updated manually.

World data is downloaded from Statworx using their API at https://api.statworx.com/covid; the underlying data is from the Johns Hopkins CSSE Covid tracker.  My code checks the age of the current download and automatically updates it if the data is more than 12 hours old.

## Code

The reports are generated by two Rmarkdown (.Rmd) files:

+ [us_covid_rates.Rmd](./us_covid_rates.Rmd): Case and death rates in the USA by state
+ [world_covid_rates.Rmd](./world_covid_rates.Rmd): Case and death rates worldwide by country

## Usage

See the file [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md) for instructions on how to update the analyses.
